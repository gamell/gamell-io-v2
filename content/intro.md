Hi there, I am a Software Engineer from originally from Barcelona working at  [Slack](https://slack.com/)  in San Francisco.

I write  [Gray Matters ðŸ§ ](https://graymatters.substack.com/)  with Mario Chamorro, a weekly newsletter about Tech, Productivity and the "New Normal". I also have other articles on  [Medium](https://medium.com/@gamell), mostly  [rants about Software Development](https://medium.com/hackernoon/you-have-to-choose-between-software-delivered-on-time-and-good-software-44f4af1249b1). You can find my latest writings  [below](#articles).

I love photography and while I think I have  [some pretty good pictures](#photography), I don't post on  [instagram](https://instagram.com/jgamell)  too often. Oh well.

Lastly, you can also check out my  [coding projects](#projects)  or  [my resume & contact information](#contact)  towards the bottom. Thanks for stopping by, I really appreciate it. You can see yourself out when you're done.
